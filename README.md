# Sending Emails

## About the Program

This program is capable of sending emails only if the user is using gmail. Despite this, it is capable of sending to any email provider. However, the program's results are most successful when the recipient(s) are also a gmail email. Results with other email providers may vary.

The program will enter whom you would like to send the email to. Optionally, you are also capable of CCing and BCCing the email to others. You are able to have unlimited recipients. Afterwards, you will be prompted to give the email a subject (required). Lastly you will be prompted to write a message.

## How to Use the Program

If you would like to use the program, you must first ensure that you're using a gmail account. Then, follow the steps listed below:

1) On Google or Gmail, click your profile circle at the top right
2) Click the "Manage your Google Account" button
3) On the left, press Security
4) Scroll down and click on 2-Step Verification
5) Scroll down and click on the arrow under App passwords
6) Name the app whatever you would like
7) Copy the password somewhere safe

Your Google account is now ready to be used! Now you can download the code, open it up, and continue following the steps:

8) Find the email_sender variable and inside the double quotes (""), type in your email
9) Next, create a python file called Secret.py with one line of code that sets my_password equal to the password you safely copied down earlier. Alternatively, delete line 7 (from Secret import my_password) and directly set the variable email_password equal to the password.

Now you're ready to use the code! Run the code and follow the prompted instructions.
